Final versions of the pipelines can be found in the pipeline.py file, within the v1.0_scripts_simplificados folder

pipeline.py has 3 main functions. The functions are commented in Spanish. 

* pipeline_generador(): 
Generates files containing ChIP-seq peaks, binding sites and genes near those binding sites or peaks. 
Gets its inputs from .bed files for ChIP-seq results and from .csv files for RNA-seq results 

* pipeline_meme_chip(): 
Generates files containing sequences in .fasta format to be sent to the MEME-ChIP program for analysis. 
Uses files generated by pipeline_generador() as input 

* pipeline_otros_tf(): 
Generates files containing binding sites of various TFs near binding sites as compiled by pipeline_generador(). 
Uses files generated by pipeline_generador() as input
